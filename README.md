# Classic Pong Game - JavaScript

This is a recreation of the classic **Pong** game, developed using JavaScript as a learning project. The game allows two players (one controlled by the user and one by the computer) to compete by bouncing a ball with paddles and scoring points.

## Features

- **Player Controls**: 
  - Use the arrow keys (↑ and ↓) to control the player's paddle.
- **Computer AI**:
  - The computer opponent adapts its movements based on the ball's position.
- **Scoring System**:
  - The first player to score a predefined number of points wins.
- **Adjustable Difficulty**:
  - The computer makes mistakes depending on the score difference, adding a layer of challenge.
- **Collision Detection**:
  - Ball-paddle and ball-wall collisions are handled with precision.
- **Audio Support** (optional):
  - Sound effects for ball collisions and scoring (uncomment lines in the code to enable).

## How to Play

1. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Make sure you have the [p5.js library](https://p5js.org/) included in your project.
   - Place the code in a `.js` file and link it to an HTML file with a `<script>` tag.

2. **Run the Game**:
   - Open the HTML file in your browser to start the game.

3. **Controls**:
   - **Arrow Up (↑)**: Move paddle up.
   - **Arrow Down (↓)**: Move paddle down.

4. **Objective**:
   - Prevent the ball from passing your paddle while trying to score by hitting it past the opponent's paddle.
